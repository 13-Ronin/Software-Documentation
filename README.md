# How we manage the development process

One of the key points that we need in the team is the well-organized and easy-to-access information. We need to be tidy, so we should use a special type of app for messaging and chatting like Slack and Discord. Emails are professional but are more useful for important information and between different teams, it is not suitable for daily communication between the team members. We used **Discord** which enables us to create multiple categories for each sub-team, and for each of the categories we can create channels for each part of the software, backend, frontend, and mobile app development.

To organize our documents including this one, we used **Notion** which provides a good way to create page embed resources like links and files in the document. Notion also has a very powerful feature, databases.

One of the documents here is the requirements document where we write the features and the requirements of the system and the additional features which we may work on. We could’ve used Notion to manage tasks and sprints (or cycles) as well it is a bit harder for us to create the databases of tasks and link them together. When powerful and feature-rich apps like Jira and Linear exist it is not a wise decision to build the process here in notion.

We chose **Linear**, the relatively new app which is gaining more user base and popularity in the software industry. It doesn’t only provide a way to add tasks (also called issues) and assign them to users. It provides a way to set a roadmap for the team and split the project into multiple smaller projects. Linear also has another feature that is crucial for our team, cycles. Our cycle is 1 week where we plan, develop, and test the tasks, and during the cycle, we review our progress and plan for the next cycle. This way, we keep our work organized and efficient.

List of apps and services used:

1. **Notion**: documents and resources management.
2. **Google Drive**: documents and resources management.
3. **Linear**: tasks, weekly plans, and roadmaps.
4. **GitHub**: services to manage git repositories and CI/CD processes.
5. **Discord**: chatting and communication.
6. **Figma**: prototyping and designing UI/UX.
7. **VSCode**: development and writing code.
